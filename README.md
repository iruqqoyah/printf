Global variables are not allowed
No more than 5 functions per file
Headers
The prototypes of all functions should be included in header file called holberton.h
All header files should be include guarded
Compilation
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
code will be compiled this way: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
Tests
The main.c file with tests contains all the tests
The main.c file is commited under the test folder
To make it work:
Make a symbolic link to the test/main.c file to the root of the project: ln -s test/main.c .
Compile project with -Wno-format extra flag: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -Wno-format *.c
